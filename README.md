Welcome to the CMSI402 wiki!

Project Proposal A google glass and mobile biking app that allows users to track their rides, routes, times, records, training plans, gives live updates to the users during the ride, and also allows users to see others using the app and notifies them if people are close to ride together.

There are similar mobile and glass workout apps like strava or race yourself, but none (yet) that incorporate a social networking meet up aspect. This would set this app aside from others allowing bikers to meet other bikers so people can ride in groups instead of alone.

Name Ideas Bike with Friends? (or strangers)
